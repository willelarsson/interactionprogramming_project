DISCLAIMER:

The API used for this project is sometimes very unstable and has a pretty restricted amount of data. For this project we've created placeholders for some attributes we think are missing in the API, for example some lorem-ipsum-descriptions and locally saved png:s for each beverage type.
Sometimes the site runs a "-1 error message"-error. This is caused by CORS (or some problem with our proxy use) and is fixed simply by reloading the page. This was earlier said not to be considered in the grading process.
Here is the link to the API used, so you can see for yourselves the restricted data and url-parameters: https://market.mashape.com/karlroos/systemet
